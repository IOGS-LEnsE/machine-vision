Labworks Platforms Development / Main Contributors
==================================================


Initial Idea
------------

The original idea of this platform borned with a regular request for training in Machine Vision to the *CONTINUING EDUCATION* service of the **Institut d'Optique**.

This platform was also designed as a main industrial application of image processing for our future engineer in photonics.

Initial Design
--------------

The initial design of the platform was performed by **Thierry AVIGNON**, technical engineer at LEnsE, and **Julien VILLEMEJANE**, professor at LEnsE.

The main objective was to integrate the **basic components of an industrial machine vision platform** (image sensor, lighting system, image processing) and a sorting application level.

Learning outcomes targeted by this platform are for our future engineer :

* list the main components of a machine vision system
* choose and interface image sensor (and optical system) to obtain relevant images
* experiment the impact of the lighting system on the quality of the image
* develop a sorting application of pieces, depending on their shape or/and their color

Main development

A first platform was developped at LEnsE in
